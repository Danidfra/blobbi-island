# NIP.md — Blobbi Island Custom Event Kinds

This document describes the custom Nostr event kinds used by **Blobbi Island**, a
Nostr-native virtual creature game. Some of these kinds are co-authored with the
**Ditto** backend, which acts as the canonical source of truth for game state and
may set additional tags not produced by this client. This client preserves unknown
tags when republishing replaceable/addressable events.

All custom kinds include a NIP-31 `alt` tag where applicable to provide a
human-readable description for clients that do not understand the kind.

## Summary

| Kind | Name | Class | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| `1124` | Blobbi Social Interaction | Regular | Append-only log of care/social actions (feed, play, etc.) |
| `11125` | Blobbonaut Owner Profile | Replaceable | Player profile: coins, inventory, achievements, current companion |
| `31124` | Blobbi Pet State | Addressable | Full state of a single Blobbi creature (stats, appearance, care timestamps) |
| `31950` | Island Presence | Addressable | Real-time multiplayer presence (location, position, movement) |
| `21201` | Island Chat | Ephemeral | In-world speech-bubble chat messages |

### Legacy / superseded kinds (queried for backward compatibility, not written)

| Kind | Superseded by | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| `14919` | `1124` | Old interaction kind from the original NIP-BB draft |
| `31125` | `11125` | Old owner-profile kind |

## Kind 1124 — Blobbi Social Interaction (Regular)

Append-only record of an interaction a player performed on a Blobbi (feeding,
playing, cleaning, etc.). Used as an audit/history log; the resulting state change
is reflected in the corresponding kind `31124` event.

- **`content`**: optional freeform text or empty string.
- **Tags**:
  - `["a", "31124:<pubkey>:<blobbiD>"]` — the Blobbi this interaction targets.
  - `["t", "<interaction-type>"]` — e.g. `feed`, `play`.
  - `["client", "blobbi-island"]`.
  - `["alt", "<human-readable description>"]`.

---

## Kind 11125 — Blobbonaut Owner Profile (Replaceable)

The player's account/profile. One per pubkey. Co-authored with Ditto; unknown tags
(e.g. `xp`, `level`, progression markers) are preserved by this client.

- **`content`**: optional; canonical structured fields are carried in tags.
- **Notable tags** (non-exhaustive):
  - `["coins", "<number>"]`
  - `["current_companion", "<blobbiD>"]`
  - `["starter_blobbi", "<blobbiD>"]`
  - `["favorite_blobbi", "<blobbiD>"]`
  - `["pet", "<blobbiD>"]` (repeatable — owned pets)
  - `["achievement", "<id>"]` (repeatable)
  - `["item", "<id>", "<qty>"]` (repeatable — inventory)
  - `["alt", "Blobbonaut owner profile"]`

---

## Kind 31124 — Blobbi Pet State (Addressable)

Full state of an individual Blobbi creature. Addressable by
`31124:<pubkey>:<d>` where `d` is the Blobbi's stable id. Co-authored with Ditto;
unknown tags are preserved.

- **`d`**: the Blobbi id.
- **`content`**: optional.
- **Notable tags** (non-exhaustive):
  - Identity: `["name", ...]`, `["stage", "egg"|"baby"|"adult"]`, `["generation", ...]`, `["adult_type", ...]`
  - Stats (0–100): `["hunger", ...]`, `["happiness", ...]`, `["health", ...]`, `["hygiene", ...]`, `["energy", ...]`
  - Progress: `["experience", ...]`, `["care_streak", ...]`
  - Appearance: `["base_color", ...]`, `["secondary_color", ...]`, `["eye_color", ...]`, `["pattern", ...]`, `["special_mark", ...]`
  - Personality: `["personality", ...]`, `["trait", ...]`, `["mood", ...]`
  - Behavior: `["is_sleeping", "true"|"false"]`, `["is_dirty", ...]`, etc.
  - `["alt", "Blobbi pet state"]`

## Kind 31950 — Island Presence (Addressable, NIP-40 Expiration)

Real-time multiplayer presence. Each browser session publishes one addressable
event keyed by session id, renewed by a heartbeat (~25s) and expiring via NIP-40
(~35s) so stale players disappear automatically. Movement is broadcast as a
*goal* (start/end/velocity/timestamp); each client interpolates remote motion
locally rather than streaming positions.

- **`d`**: `session:<uuid>` — one presence per session (latest session per pubkey wins).
- **Tags**:
  - `["a", "31124:<pubkey>:<blobbiD>"]` — links to the Blobbi being shown.
  - `["t", "blobbi:presence"]` — global presence index.
  - `["t", "island:<islandId>"]` — island scope.
  - `["t", "loc:<location>"]` — current location scope (enables relay-level location filtering).
  - `["expiration", "<unix-seconds>"]` — NIP-40.
- **`content`** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "state": "idle" | "moving" | "emote",
    "location": "<locationId>",
    "anchor": { "x": <0-100>, "y": <0-100>, "ts": <unix-seconds> },
    "goal": { "from": {"x","y"}, "to": {"x","y"}, "v": <px/s>, "ts": <unix-seconds> },
    "blobbiD": "<blobbiD>"
  }
  ```
  Positions are percentages of the location's playable area (`0–100`), making them
  resolution-independent. `goal` is omitted when the player is stationary.

> Note: `state: "emote"` is reserved for a future emote/reaction feature and is not
> yet produced by this client.

## Kind 21201 — Island Chat (Ephemeral)

In-world chat shown as a speech bubble above a player's Blobbi. Ephemeral
(20000–29999) with a short NIP-40 expiration; messages are transient and not
expected to be stored.

- **Tags**:
  - `["d", "<sessionId>"]`
  - `["l", "<location>"]` — location scope.
  - `["i", "<islandId>"]` — island scope.
  - `["p", "<pubkey>"]` — author.
  - `["expiration", "<unix-seconds>"]` — NIP-40 (~10s).
  - `["alt", "Chat message: <preview>"]`.
- **`content`** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "type": "chat",
    "location": "<locationId>",
    "blobbiD": "<blobbiD>",
    "text": "<message, max 120 chars>",
    "ts": <unix-seconds>
  }
  ```
  Received `text` is HTML-stripped before rendering. Messages are deduplicated per
  `pubkey:d` within a short window.

## Identity & Relays

Blobbi Island uses standard Nostr identity (NIP-07 / NIP-46 / nsec) and standard
kind `0` metadata for display names and avatars. Game state lives in the custom
kinds above. Relay configuration is standard Nostr; the default relay is
`wss://relay.ditto.pub`.
